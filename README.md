# Daily Routine Application

This is a simple yet effective Daily Routine application built using React Native and Expo Framework. The app allows users to manage their daily routines with two key features:

- **Today Routine:** Displays the list of tasks for the current day.
- **All Routines:** Lists all routines in chronological order for easy management and tracking.

## Features

- Add, update, delete, and view daily routines.
- View today's routines in a separate tab.
- View all routines sorted by date in chronological order.
- Persistent storage using SQLite to ensure routines are saved even after closing the app.

## Tech Stack

- **Expo:** A framework and platform for universal React applications.
- **React Native:** For building mobile applications.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight database used for local data storage within the app.
- **npm Packages:**
  - `react-native-sqlite-storage` for SQLite database integration.
  - `react-navigation` for handling navigation between screens.
  - Other utility libraries as needed.
